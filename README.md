# scattered-storage
An agnostic management system for the Ceph storage platform.

## Why?
After spending more than a decade helping employers and clients work with 
a fragmented ecosystem of tools for the management of their Ceph clusters 
I have grown tired of constantly having to solve the same problems.

Inspired by the ethos behind Ceph, this software is an attempt at building 
a hardware, OS, and tooling agnostic management system for Ceph.
